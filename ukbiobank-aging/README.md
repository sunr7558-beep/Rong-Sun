Situation: Large-scale genomic and phenotypic data (millions of rows) required quality control and preprocessing.
Task: Standardize formats and build robust pipelines for downstream analysis.
Action: Processed 5M+ demographic/mortality records; standardized 1M+ SNPs in PLINK; applied KNN imputation and Isolation Forest; built logistic regression models with SHAP interpretation.
Result: Produced clean datasets supporting GWAS, enabling interpretable aging-risk profiles.
